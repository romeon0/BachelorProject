%%% FAQ1
* What application do?<br>
The aplication detects handwritted text and transforms it in editable text for calculus systems(laptop,PC,telephone and so on).<br> 
%%%
%%% FAQ2
* How can I user the application?<br>
If you want to detect letters you need to train "The Brain" of aplication, or load saved memory.
- In first case you need to select option "New network" from "Network" menu.
To training The Brain we need to training phase when it learn from examples, testing phase when we are watching how many knowledge it learning and recognizing phase where the user draw letters or words and The Brain is guessing.<br>
- If we don't want to train The Brain we need to select "Load network from..." option and search saved memory file or "Load network" to load predefinited memory file.
If file structure isn't damaged we will find saved memory in directory "[application directory]/files/network" and it is named "memory.weights".

%%% FAQ3
* What is a neural network?<br>
A neural network represent a simulation of human brain. Similarly with human brain neural network has neurons and connections between them.
%%%
%%% FAQ4
* What is learning rate?<br>
The learning rate represent the speed that The Brain learn, so it will find solution much faster, 
no differences what problem is: character detecting, resolving a creding or so on.
It is important to say that too big learning rate can jump the solution of problem.
%%%
%%% FAQ5
* What is epoch?<br>
A epochs is a iteration in which The Brain processed all examples and for each example obtained a response and corrected its knowledges based on correct answer.
